# Tevatron (for Promptriever)

This repository makes a few changes to the original tevatron repo including:
- Making sure that the the instruction-negatives are included in training
- Enabling GPU Faiss search
- Arguments for prompting and prompt-formatting

Otherwise it is nearly identical. Please refer to their documentation for specific questions to parts that are not described above.
